I created `monaco-graphql`. I converted `graphiql` into a monorepo, merging the LSP service and codemirror repositories, and I help maintain `graphiql`, `graphql-playground`, the `graphql-language-service-server` and cli, `graphql-language-service` and `vscode-graphql`. I was made a maintainer of graphiql after advancing the input union spec by creating reference PRs - you can become a maintainer too!
