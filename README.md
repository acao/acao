### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm *Rikki* ~ :sparkles:

**pronouns**: She/Her, or they/them is fine

**location**: US

I made the mistake of introducing a human rights agenda to the GraphiQL repository, which led to a harassment and doxxing campaign

The only mistake was that I didn't talk to my co-maintainers first, and now they are being asked to take sides in an apartheid situation they know nothing about. Please leave my colleauges be. They had nothing to do with this.
