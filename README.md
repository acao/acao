### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm *Rikki* ~ :sparkles:

**Pronouns**: She/Her, or they/them is fine

**Location**: Berlin, Germany

**Hobbies**: Dancing, Poetry, Plants, Climbing, Mischief, Mermaid things, Geospatial analysis for the earth!

**Projects**
* I've created [`codemirror-json-schema`](https://github.org/acao/codemirror-json-schema) mode with @imolorhe with support for json4 and json5! It is the first general purpose open source web IDE with json schema support for json5
* I created [`monaco-graphql`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/monaco-graphql) which provides full language features for graphql files and json variables for `monaco-editor`. 
* Since 2018 I've helped to maintain:
  * [`graphiql`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphiql)
  * [`graphql-language-service-server`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphql-language-service-server)
  * [`graphql-language-service-cli`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphql-language-service-cli) (also known as `graphql-lsp`)
  * [`graphql-language-service`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphql-language-service)
  * [`vscode-graphql`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/vscode-graphql)
  * [`codemirror-graphql`](https://github.org/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/codemirror-graphql) and everything else in our beloved monorepo. 

* I've created [A Soil Organic Carbon Estimation tool](https://geoblaze-gsoc.vercel.app), to demonstrate the power of browser side raster analysis using [`geoblaze`](https://geoblaze.io), and to democratize access to this important climate data.
* I regularly contribute documentation, bugfixes and improvements to many other open source projects that I use!
* I provide instructive articles in my areas of speciality and interest on my [engineering blog](https://rikki.dev/posts)

**Work Availability**

* I am available for consulting in the US and Germany, but would be most interested in working for a stable & established company.
* I am very talented across the fullstack, whether it be microservices, react.js, node.js, devops & build tooling,and beyond!
* I help build and grow the capacity and velocity of engineering teams, readily take on new & complex problem domains, and strive to make product development better for users and engineers at any company
