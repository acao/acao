### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm *Rikki* ~ :sparkles:

**pronouns**: She/Her, or they/them is fine

**location**: Berlin, DE


I created `monaco-graphql`. I converted `graphiql` into a monorepo, and I help maintain `graphiql`, `graphql-playground`, the `graphql-language-service-server` and `vscode-graphql`. 

I need a replacement or three! If you want to help bottomline any of these projects, let us know!
